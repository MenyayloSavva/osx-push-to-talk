# OSX PushToTalk

OSX status bar application that mutes microphone until `fn` is pressed.

Icon will turn orange when microphone is not muted.

Double press `fn` or use a menu by clicking on the icon to reverse the behaviour.

## Troubleshooting

### The app is from an unidentified developer

I did not sign the App. To enable exception for this app follow https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11436?locale=en_US

If you want to be sure, just compile the project, Archive & export PushToTalk.app
